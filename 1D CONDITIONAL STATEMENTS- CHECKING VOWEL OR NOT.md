## Experiment No: 1d – Conditional Statements- Checking Person has Fever or Not
## AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether the person has fever using simple if statement.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a temperature input value from the user.
5. If it is greater than 97 degrees, display "The person has fever".
6. Otherwise, display "".
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Read the temperature from the user
temperature = float(input())

# Check if the temperature is greater than 97°F
if temperature > 97:
    print("The person has fever")
else:
    print("")
```
