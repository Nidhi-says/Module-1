# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Exponent of given Number 

## AIM
To write a python program for finding the exponent of the given number using "**="  operator.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Read base and exponent input values from the user.
4. Perform the exponentiation of the two numbers using the `**=` operator.
5. Print the results.
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Read the base and exponent values from the user
base = int(input())  # The base number
exponent = int(input())  # The exponent value

# Use the '**=' operator to calculate the exponentiation
base **= exponent  # base = base ** exponent

# Print the result
print(base)
```
